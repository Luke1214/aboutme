  <img src="guacamole.jpg" alt="Guacamole" align="left" hspace="15" width="300" height="200">
    <p>To prepare guacamole, start by mashing ripe avocados in a bowl. 
        Add finely chopped onions, tomatoes, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime 
        juice for flavor. Season with salt and pepper, and for extra spice, 
        toss in diced jalapenos. Mix everything together until smooth but slightly 
        chunky. </p>
        
    <p> To eat guacamole, serve it as a dip with tortilla chips, spread 
        it on toast, or use it as a topping for tacos, burritos, or salads.</p>
